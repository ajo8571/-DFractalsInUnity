# 3d Fractals in unity
## Background 
### What Are Fractals?
### Real World Applications
Fractals are useful for creating mathematical models of real-world objects that are self-similar, such as snowflakes or coastlines on a map. These objects are difficult to measure by traditional methods because their boundaries become more complex the closer you look at them.
